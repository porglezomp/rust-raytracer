This is a blog chronicling my experience learning Rust by writing a raytracer. It will cover challenges and potential pitfalls, as well as a lot of excitement about how elegantly some features of Rust work.

The code for the raytracer as well as the source for this blog can be found at [the github page](https://github.com/porglezomp/rust-raytracer), and Rust itself can be found at [rust-lang.org](http://rust-lang.org).
